october escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber to mckinney lara subject fw texas monthly november escapenumber how enron blew it this is a long one but definitely worth reading cover title enron's cutthroat culture how enron blew it less than a year ago the houston based energy behemoth had everything money power glitz smarts new ideas and a ceo who wanted to make it the most important company in the world now its stock is down wall street is bearish and the ceo is gone what went wrong by mimi swartz the enron skyscraper near the south end of houston's downtown feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest the lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the old fashioned oil companies like shell and texaco nearby enron in contrast throbs with modernity the people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white brown asian middle eastern european african as well as american born they are young mostly under escapenumber and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry the guys wear khakis polo shirts and banana republic button downs almost preposterously fit they move through the building intently like winners enron is nothing if not energetic a big brother size tv screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage a sculpture of the corporate symbol an e tipped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis a starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratulating enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between elevator banks declares enron's simple if grandiose goal from the world's leading energy company to the world's leading company for a while that future seemed guaranteed as enron transformed itself from a stodgy troubled pipeline company in escapenumber to a trading colossus in escapenumber it was a wall street darling with a stock price that increased escapenumber escapenumber percent in that sixteen year period with revenues that increased from escapenumber billion to escapenumber billion the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a escapenumber report from global change associates a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business this enron was largely the creation of jeff skilling a visionary determined to transform american business hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then ceo ken lay skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers instead it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water if you had a risky drilling venture enron would fund it for a piece of the action if you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined enron could do the job if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs enron was there to build and build basically if an idea was new and potentially and fantastically lucrative enron wanted the first crack and with each success enron became ever more certain of its destiny the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high tech world and in february of this year skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer enron says skilling was a great marriage of the risk taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk taking mentality of the financial markets the enron story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century like the high tech companies it emulated enron was going to reinvent the american business model and in turn the american economy maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but the best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacent those who could see the future versus those who could not the key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital with the best and the brightest a company couldn't possibly go wrong or could it today enron's stock trades at around escapenumber down from a high of escapenumber in january the press cast enron as the archvillain of california's energy crisis last spring and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market a long troubled power plant project in india threatened the company's global ambitions telecommunications in which enron was heavily invested imploded wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices some of the change in enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame enron jeff skilling says had a totally different way of thinking about business we got it at enron in fact you either got it or you were gone it was as simple as black and white it is not coincidental then that the color scheme of skilling's river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed here the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets billowy sofas set off the jet black baby grand in the entry white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white marble there is only one off color note after almost twenty years jeff skilling is no longer associated with enron having resigned abruptly after just six months as ceo once skilling was hailed as the next jack welch general electric's masterful ceo as one of worth magazine's best ceo's in america anointed in escapenumber and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which a friend told businessweek someone could actually get killed today he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning i had no idea what i'd let go of skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling enron from a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons skilling clarifies the demands of working escapenumber escapenumber for enron caused him to ignore his personal finances divorced he lived in a escapenumber escapenumber square foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher he almost missed his brother's wedding learning a foreign language i never learned a foreign language he exclaims he never once took his youngest son to school i'm interested in the kids you don't do kids in fifteen minute scheduling travel you can't go to africa for a week and get anything out of it skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs i'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a ceo's job he says finally then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains its pragmatic edge it would have been easy to stay he says but that would not have been good for me he's a smallish ruddy faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight handsome in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze but the impatience skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button down and his matching blue eyes look put upon i'm surprised he says that people have so much trouble understanding this people who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the enron building from nine to five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad they always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed whatever people knew about enron in those days and most people didn't know much it was often associated with that scene enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in houston and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past what macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation but this company was a child of another time that period in the mid eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a volatile free for all the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company houston natural gas hng found itself under attack from coastal corporation oscar wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm hng was then run by lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war lay who was from missouri and never succumbed at least outwardly to texas brashness had done well enough thanks to canny expansions hng's pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of texas hng fended off coastal but to protect the company from other takeover attempts lay nimbly engineered the sale of hng in escapenumber to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called internorth one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time then a funny thing happened hng started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come a lot like coastal what the nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being called the merger back in houston and before long following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston the company's center of gravity started shifting toward texas and shortly after that ken lay was running a new company called enron over time it became clear that lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with enron at that time he never fought change he embraced change lay had won but what exactly did that mean enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines without new ideas for that matter a whole new business plan the company could be finished before it really even got started like many people who teamed up with enron in the eighties jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest and he was self made at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start up tv station in aurora illinois his mother would drop him off there every day after school i liked being successful when i was working and i was smart he told businessweek earlier this year but unlike many of his enron colleagues skilling wasn't deliberate and soft spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call intellectual capital he loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people he graduated from southern methodist university went into banking assets and liability management and took on harvard business school where he graduated in the top escapenumber percent of his class then skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped up path to american success he joined manhattan's mckinsey and company as a business consultant and that is where ken lay found him in escapenumber it is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of skilling probably saved the company skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked while everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses and so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by skilling came up with what he called the gas bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers enron would not be a broker but a banker it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved and enron would make money on transactions much like an investment bank would skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about escapenumber enron executives he had a one page presentation almost to a person skilling says they thought it was stupid almost after skilling left the meeting dejected he walked ken lay to an elevator and apologized lay listened and then said let's go the gas bank was not an overnight success for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him in fact he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life i believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right fairly soon after launching the company sold escapenumber million worth of gas in a week true to skilling's character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new he says the joke around enron was that if a company's ceo was under fifty we were in and he was in too in escapenumber skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation a new division created just for him in escapenumber that company closed a deal that earned escapenumber million in profit after that says skilling we never looked back skilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it the company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the best access to supplies that in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play with so many customers in its pocket enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but with startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined this change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made he created within enron a new culture to match its new trading business the idea was to build a knowledge based business which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by enron's employees from the old hng days most were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most of them men of course the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make money lots of money for themselves and for the company enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had narrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard stanford and maybe rice and because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks like merrill lynch or credit suisse first boston in addition to being smart enron people were also supposed to be aggressive you were right for enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization you could see what he was looking for on super saturdays at the houston headquarters eight fifty minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day they were scored from escapenumber to escapenumber on their smarts their problem solving ability their passion for hard work and what at enron was called a sense of urgency people who scored less than escapenumber escapenumber were scratched the shrewdest candidates knew how to work enron before they were even hired these were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer knowing enron would come back with more the starting salary was around escapenumber escapenumber maybe it wasn't a fortune yet but the signing bonus about escapenumber escapenumber was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown enron people didn't live in far flung suburbs suburbs were uncool and too far from the office for the lucky winners enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted and talented program new associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals and there were rotations at enron offices around the globe the hours were long but every possible need was taken care of a company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning the house planning a vacation of course a lot of people who worked for enron never got to take vacations they were too busy making money but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers if they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join enron's wellness program massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until ten at night they were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going skilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms analysts associates directors and managing directors but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter money did instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses enron offered competitive salaries and merit based bonuses with no cap if you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says ken rice who stayed with enron for escapenumber years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a escapenumber million bonus and the more you produced the closer you got to jeff real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia land cruiser racing in australia or off road motorcycling in a re creation of the baja escapenumber escapenumber race ending at a spectacular mexican villa every time he'd speak i'd believe everything he'd say one loyalist says and why not by escapenumber enron had become north america's largest natural gas merchant controlling escapenumber percent of the market but at a company where the buzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop skilling and lay believed the gas bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for enron they began barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents who with their multimillion dollar salaries and monopoly service areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who were somewhat more receptive thanks in part to enron's generous lobbying efforts but the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling in escapenumber ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company by then the division known as enron capital and trade resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity the division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from escapenumber billion to escapenumber billion mr skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the new york times noted everyone would certainly have thought so enron and skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another firing up an idea machine enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within sang the new york times in escapenumber in the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies enron corp is that gate crashing elvis crowed fortune in escapenumber wall street was demanding tech size growth on a tech timetable and enron in escapenumber obliged with second quarter earnings of escapenumber million up escapenumber percent from the previous year that year the company seemed to discover a market a minute under skilling enron was trading coal paper steel and even weather no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client people drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn but most exciting to the financial world was enron's entry into high tech communications because of the company's marketing dominance enrononline became another overnight success handling escapenumber billion in commodity trades online in escapenumber enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price then there was the broadband business to enron trading excess capacity in large high speed fiber optic networks empty lanes on the fabled information highway wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines so enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth soon after it also announced a twenty year deal with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes enron looked like a company that couldn't lose its strategy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market businessweek insisted there was however another reason enron did so well in such a short time the company's hard nosed approach toward its customers the old notion of customer service was based on the long haul you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them but enron had new markets and new ideas customers had to come to it over time the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them counterparties skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable gains were maximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated so if you wanted to launch a high risk venture quickly such as zilkha energy's new high tech approach to drilling for oil you got your financing from enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project if it ever would but because enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them enron could set the terms of its deals from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all while many businesses used what was known in the industry as mark to market accounting for instance enron used it on an unprecedented scale the company priced their deals at current market value but it was always enron's idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals and while old fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years enron took most of its profit up front however many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in as the market fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough enron is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to enron's attitude toward charity when a fundraiser for the houston read commission a literacy group called on enron for a contribution it was suggested that he start raising money for enron's competing literacy charity even the person who was supposed to give money away for enron was supposed to make money for enron he says as enron became more and more successful the culture skilling had created took on a dark side the competition turned inward as one member of the enron family put it it became a company full of mercenaries the change started at the bottom as enron's domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away new associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded global change's enron spies reported overhearing orders like i need a smart person go buy me one or buy me an intelligent slave quick enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on self parody a random acts of kindness program lasted only a few months it was too disruptive people couldn't get their work done and of course enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension the performance review committee which had initially been installed by skilling in the capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country employees were rated on a scale of one to five and those with fives were usually gone within six months the prc's nickname quickly became rank and yank it was a point of pride that skilling's division replaced escapenumber percent of its workforce every year as one skilling associate put it jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store skilling's approach to business get in and get out had become enron's attitude toward its workers in time it would become many workers' attitude toward the company teamwork never that valuable in a trading culture went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus if protocol required an enron higher up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world he might help or he might not depending on whether another potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future says one former employee anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad prc scores as were the higher ups who had backed them past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in prc meetings that the phrase no old tapes became an enron clich\\u00c3\\u00a9 people went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former enron executive in such a hothouse paranoia flowered new contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company e mail was monitored a former executive routinely carried two laptops one for the company and one for himself people may have been rich at enron but they weren't necessarily happy one recruiter described the culture this way they roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death before jeff skilling could transform enron from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company he had to make one more change just as he had done ten years before skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order where enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets pipelines power plants they may have been enron's pride but skilling wanted them gone expensive long term building projects had no place when wall street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital and skilling knew it it wasn't the time for long term approaches an enron executive says of wall street's mood it was the technology era to rid enron of the last vestiges of its past skilling had to take on rebecca mark long considered his rival for the ceo's job mark was for many years the poster child for the enron way young attractive aggressive her nickname was mark the shark she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international the asset heavy side of the company where she developed escapenumber billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for escapenumber percent of enron's profits in escapenumber for this she reaped breathtaking compensation one enron executive estimated escapenumber million and adoring press clips including two appearances on fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate america but then mark ran into trouble with a gas fired power plant in dabhol india one of the largest ever constructed she had played the game the enron way taking enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes escapenumber percent instead of the usual escapenumber and hung in through escapenumber lawsuits and three changes in government but the time and expense needed to make india and other enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with enron's goals and skilling's impatience with mark grew forcing mark out however was no easy matter key executives left divisions were dismantled but she remained the truth was enron didn't mind firing lower level employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relentless people it tended to promote the company preferred humiliation keeping a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public relations disaster so lay and skilling did something classically enronian they gave mark her own company despite skilling's contempt for asset heavy businesses enron spent more than escapenumber billion to buy a run of the mill british water utility that could serve as enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization mark was put in charge of making enron yes the world's greatest water company azurix as the new business was called looked like another sure thing its ipo in escapenumber raised escapenumber million but mark had to succeed on enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities water is not like gas or electricity owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money the company stumbled layoffs commenced and confidence evaporated by august escapenumber the stock price which had started out at escapenumber had fallen to escapenumber mark's resignation followed and azurix much diminished was folded into enron i think it's best for rebecca to start afresh lay who had been a mentor to mark told the wall street journal or as one critic put it they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business as escapenumber drew to a close skilling was in total command in december ken lay announced the inevitable the best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well he told the press enron is doing extremely well now in february escapenumber jeff skilling took over the ceo's job almost immediately the trouble started enron's domination of the electric power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle both pbs's frontline and the new york times took on enron portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in washington lay and enron's political action committee are the top contributors to george w bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity skilling and lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in california as both tried to buy power online the times reported that lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation the bad press was to say the least ironic just as the media was pounding enron for its omnipotence wall street was discovering its weaknesses by late march the stock price had slid to escapenumber a share from escapenumber in january within enron the asset based divisions took the rap for the decline the india plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within enron's management team but the california situation was more visible and therefore more damaging despite enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had for three months gray davis did a very good job of blaming us says mark palmer a vice president for corporate communications we were a texas company there was a texan in the white house california was a state that didn't put him in office and his biggest contributor was a texas energy company performance is going to take care of our stock price the truth will take care of gray davis california utilities still owe enron escapenumber million another reason stockholders might be panicky but more problematic than the crisis itself was skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition facing down his critics he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic at least the titanic went down with its lights on but the biggest problem was enron's telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price investors believed that enron could revolutionize high speed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber optic cable would grow from escapenumber billion in escapenumber to escapenumber billion by escapenumber but then the tech bubble burst so too did the much hyped movies on demand deal with blockbuster for the first time in its confoundingly successful life enron had nothing new to take to market like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street skilling launched a campaign to keep enron's most important cheerleaders the stock analysts in the tent but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant during the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who challenged enron's financial reporting an asshole when the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets ignoring the growing chorus critical of enron's accounting skilling promised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner there wasn't any positive news carol coale of prudential financial says now basically he talked me out of a downgrade the business press so generous in the past turned surly fortune had asked in march whether enron was overpriced start with a pretty straightforward question how exactly does enron make its money the routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale skilling had sold escapenumber million worth ken lay and ken rice close to four times that amount then the wall street journal reported on a fund run by the cfo that had been a source of strife within the company it was essentially risk management against enron's possible failures every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price by late august it had fallen below escapenumber enron so institutionally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine when wall street is in love with a stock they're forgiving of something like accounting says carol coale when a company falls out of favor all these issues carry more weight this fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience those who had looked the other way as the most powerful enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways it just created an attitude one executive still at enron says if senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard there was a real culture of 'we're above everyone else ' loyalty had never been prized at enron so there was no reason to expect it now an old fashioned slow moving company like exxon could demand hardship duty in baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road but as one houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad as it turned out that description applied to jeff skilling too as the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration then after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in england he had an epiphany life was short for him enron was over ever stoic ken lay returned to the ceo's office named a new president arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler enron in the future trading anything and everything was out the company lay says will still innovate but innovate much closer to our core as for the culture things like the performance review committee i think we could have applied better by trying to categorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a morale problem that skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence despite skilling's lengthy tenure with enron he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on but now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble it was different even jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits but on the day we meet skilling is looking forward not back look he says with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in enron were my interests aligned with the shareholders absolutely free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas his eyes flash as he talks about new technologies the first wave never gets it right he says the stand alone dot coms didn't work but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world houston he promises will become the world's center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it in fact he is already shopping for office space this is the second wave and enron's got it he says almost breathless there are thousands of people running around the streets of houston that get it \",\n          \"there is no inventory on soescapenumber credits we did not record a cost of sales entry original message from white nicole sent
